## Description

This application allows the user to create a professional README.md file based off of user input. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the uses of the node, npm, and Inquirer softwares with JavaScript to write files. Using a template literal allowed me to create a template of the markdown format for a professional README file and then use Inquirer input to fill in the user's information.

## Installation

Make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine. Then run "npm i" from your terminal and the package.json will make sure Inquirer is installed into the directory.

## Usage

Navigate into the directory from your terminal, then run "node index.js". The terminal will then prompt you for input that you can type in and enter or select from a list. Once you've finished, the application will generate your README.md file into the root directory.
